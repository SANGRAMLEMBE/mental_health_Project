## 📘 Abstract

This study focuses on evaluating and forecasting the psychological well-being of engineering students by using various machine learning algorithms. It uses responses from a structured questionnaire designed to measure multiple psychological dimensions. The study aims to classify students as psychologically “well” or “unwell” and identify the most influential factors affecting their mental health.

## 🎯 Objectives

- To assess psychological well-being using standardized survey data.
- To develop machine learning models to predict student mental health outcomes.
- To determine key features influencing psychological states.

## 📊 Dataset

- Data collected through a questionnaire administered to **202 engineering students**.
- Questions cover areas like:
  - Personal well-being
  - Academic pressure
  - Social and emotional conditions
  - Physical and lifestyle habits

> Note: The survey was conducted anonymously and ethically.

## 📈 Results

| Machine Learning Model | Accuracy  |
|------------------------|-----------|
| Decision Tree          | 91.67%    |
| Logistic Regression    | 86.11%    |
| K-Nearest Neighbors    | 81.94%    |
| Random Forest          | 91.67%    |
| Support Vector Machine | 88.89%    |

- **Best Performing Models**: Decision Tree and Random Forest (both at 91.67% accuracy)
